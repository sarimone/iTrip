pinIt is an app to remind the users of the highlights of their trips around the world and the users' wish lists.
Locations searched by the user will be flaged with a pin on the map. User has to select the pin's status. Users will be able to differentiate the pins status(visited/ to visit) with their colors and titles. When user opens the app will get an idea about which areas have been visited and how many are to be. Also the blogs associated with each pin  will provide the feature to upload photos and notes. User can save the highlights of their trips to the locations or even save screenshots and notes of the places they want to visit later over the time so they don't miss it when they are there.
